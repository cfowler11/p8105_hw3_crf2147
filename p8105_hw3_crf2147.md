# Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and giving illstrative examples of
observations. Then, do or answer the following (commenting on the
results of each):

This dataset has 1384617 rows and 15 variables. Each row represents a
different item ordered by a instacart customer. We have information on
the order, such as `order_id`, `order_hour_of_day`, `order_dow` or the
day of week in which the order occured, and `add_to_cart_order` which
shows the order in which items were added to the cart. We also have
information on the customer such as `user_id`, `order_number` or the
number of prior orders (+1) this customer has had, and
`days_since_prior_order`. Lastly we have information on the product
being requested such as `product_id`, `product_name`, `aisle_id`,
`aisle`, `department_id`, and `department`.

table(instacart$eval_set)
